<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When I was growing up, my mother made lasagna whenever there was family in town or a crowd to feed. The lasagna was always delicious, but since my mom never used a recipe, each time there was a moment of nervous anticipation at the dinner table before slicing the lasagna — would it be too soupy, too dry, or (hopefully) just right?</p>
<p>I’m not one to wing it with a dish like lasagna, so I came up with this surefire recipe based on my mother’s version. It is classic but elevated and also relatively simple to prepare. The key is using no-boil (or oven-ready) lasagna noodles, which not only save a lot of time but also taste similar to fresh pasta. The noodles are layered with a flavorful meat sauce — full of Italian sausage, veggies, and crushed tomatoes, and enriched with cream — as well as creamy ricotta and melty mozzarella cheese.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped</li>
   <li>2 medium carrots, roughly chopped</li>
   <li>1 stalk celery, roughly chopped</li>
   <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
   <li>5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
   <li>1-1/2 pounds Italian sausage (bulk or removed from casing)</li>
   <li>3/4 cup dry red wine</li>
   <li>1 (28 oz.) can crushed tomatoes</li>
   <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
   <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
   <li>1-1/2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
   <li>2 bay leaves</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Place the onions, garlic, carrot and celery in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade; pulse until finely minced but not puréed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage into the pan and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking the sausage into small pieces, until slightly browned but not cooked all the way through, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the partially cooked sausage to a plate. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the remaining tablespoon olive oil to the pan, reduce the heat to medium, and add the minced vegetables. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are very soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Do not brown; reduce the heat if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the wine; continue cooking, stirring to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan, until the wine is mostly absorbed by the vegetables, a few minutes.</li>
    <li>
        Add the tomatoes, cream, salt, pepper, sugar, thyme and bay leaves and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the sauce is thickened, about 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meanwhile, transfer the sausage to a cutting board and chop into smaller pieces (big chunks don't work well in lasagna).
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the sausage back to the pan and continue simmering, covered, until the sausage is fully cooked and the flavors meld together, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Fish out the bay leaves and discard.
    </li>
</ol>
